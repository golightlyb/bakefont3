# bakefont3 #

*bakefont3* is a python3 module for rasterising font glyphs into a RGBA texture
atlas.

![Example](./docs/example.png)

## TODO ##

* kerning tables aren't saved yet
* haven't tested anything yet
* docs
* clean up


## Features ##

* Unicode support
* customisable character ranges
* exports font metrics and kerning data
* efficient packing to reduce physical texture size
* uses all four colour channels to share space with other RGBA textures
* supports square and rectangle texture atlases of any size
* metrics accurate up to 1/64th of a pixel (e.g. for supersampling)


## Example Usage ##

### example-generate.py

This Python script demonstrates how to define the set of characters you want
and the font faces and font sizes you want, then generate a PNG texture atlas as
and a bakefont3 data file.

    # generates test.bf3 and test.png
    python3 example-generate.py test

### example-write.c

**TODO TODO TODO**

This program demonstrates loading and parsing a bakefont data file in C, then
using it to write some text and display it on screen using GLFW3.

    # Select a "Sans Serif" size 14 font generated earlier,
    # read text from stdin,
    # and render it to out.png

    cat text.txt | ./example-write test.png test.bf3 "Sans Serif" 14 out.png



## Dependencies ##

### For generating fonts using bakefont3:

    * Roboto and Roboto Mono fonts from [fonts.google.com](https://fonts.google.com/)
    * Python3
    * libfreetype
    * Python3 modules Pillow, numpy, freetype-py

Example:

    sudo apt-get install libfreetype6
    sudo pip3 install Pillow numpy freetype-py

### For the C example program:

    * libpng
    * libglfw3
    * a C compiler (e.g. gcc, clang)

Example:

    sudo apt-get install libpng12-0


## Useful notes ##

**When talking about font faces and glyphs, what do terms like ascent, descent,
etc. mean?**

See [1](https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/TTCH01.htm),
[2](https://www.freetype.org/freetype2/docs/tutorial/step2.html)
[3](https://www.freetype.org/freetype2/docs/glyphs/glyphs-3.html)

**Font sizes are given in pixels.**

Typographic dpi is always 72. At 72ppi, 1pt == 1px.
Convert as necessary for different devices.
