# bakefont3 #

*bakefont3* is a python3 module for rasterising font glyphs into a RGBA texture
atlas and exporting metrics and kerning information.

![Example](./docs/example.png)

## TODO ##

* haven't tested anything yet
* haven't done example of reading the data yet
* docs


## Features ##

* Unicode support
* customisable character ranges
* exports font metrics and kerning data as binary optimised for quick lookup
* efficient packing to reduce physical texture size
* can use all four colour channels to share space with other textures (can
    export RGBA, RGB, greyscale)
* supports square and rectangle texture atlases of any size
* metrics accurate up to 1/64th of a pixel (e.g. for supersampling)


## Example Usage ##

### Generate a font atlas and metrics using bakefont3 ###

A sample script, `example-generate.py`, is provided. You may like to edit it
to select the fonts, sizes and characters to generate.

    $ python3 example-generate.py

This file generates the following files:

    test.bf3
    test-rgba.png
    test-r.png
    test-g.png
    test-b.png
    test-a.png

`test-rgba.png` is a texture atlas containing rasterised glyphs in each colour
channel. The other images show the individual channels, but you don't need them.

`test.bf3` contains information about the fonts used, how to find characters
in the texture atlas, metrics and kerning information for laying out text
on a screen.

### Draw text with files generated by bakefont3 ###

A sample program, `example.c` is provided. You may like to edit it to
change the font data it tries to load.

`bakefont3.h` and `bakefont3.c` are an example interface for loading and
querying bakefont3 data.

    $ # Compile
    $ gcc -std=c99 example.c bakefont3.h bakefont3.c -o example.bin
    # # Run
    $ ./example test.bf3 test-rgba.png


## Dependencies ##

### For generating fonts using bakefont3:

    * Roboto and Roboto Mono fonts from [fonts.google.com](https://fonts.google.com/)
    * Python3
    * libfreetype
    * Python3 modules Pillow, numpy, freetype-py

Example:

    sudo apt-get install libfreetype6
    sudo pip3 install Pillow numpy freetype-py

### For the C example program:

    * libpng
    * libglfw3
    * a C compiler (e.g. gcc, clang)

Example:

    sudo apt-get install libpng12-0


## Useful notes ##

**When talking about font faces and glyphs, what do terms like ascent, descent,
etc. mean?**

See [1](https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/TTCH01.htm),
[2](https://www.freetype.org/freetype2/docs/tutorial/step2.html)
[3](https://www.freetype.org/freetype2/docs/glyphs/glyphs-3.html)

**Font sizes are given in pixels.**

Typographic dpi is always 72. At 72ppi, 1pt == 1px.
Convert as necessary for different devices.

**What is the "26.6 fixed float" format?**

This encodes a [Real number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number) as a
signed 32 bit integer. Divide by 64.0 to get the Real value. Or, multiply
a Real value by 64.0 and cast to a signed 32 bit integer to encode it.

(Don't worry about this unless you are directly parsing Bakefont3 output or
interfacing with Freetype yourself. Freetype also has a "2.14 fixed float"
format).
